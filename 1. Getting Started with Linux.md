## 1. Introduction to the Terminal

The terminal is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with the computer using text commands. Unlike using a graphical interface (GUI), you can control the computer directly by typing commands.

## 2. Basic Commands - Navigating the File System

**Command: `pwd` - (Print Working Directory)**
- **Usage:** Shows the current directory you are in.
- **Example:**
  ```sh  
  pwd
  ```
  **Output:**
  ```sh
  /home/username
  ```

**Command: `ls` - (List)**
- **Usage:** Lists files and directories in the current directory.
- **Example:**
    ```console
    ls
  ```
  **Output:**
  ```sh
  
  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Videos
  ```

**Command: `cd` - (Change Directory)**
- **Usage:** Changes the current directory to the specified directory.
- **Examples:**
  ```sh
  cd Documents
  cd ..
  cd /home/username
  ```

## 3. Creating and Managing Directories üìÅ

**Command: `mkdir` (Make Directory)**
- **Usage:** Creates a new directory.
- **Example:**
  ```console
  mkdir my_new_directory
  ```

## 4. Creating and Writing to Files üìÑüìù

**Command: `touch`**
- **Usage:** Creates an empty file.
- **Example:**
  ```console
  touch myfile.txt
  ```

**Command: `echo`**
- **Usage:** Writes text to a file.
- **Example:**
  ```console
  echo "Hello, World!" > myfile.txt
  ```

**Command: `nano` (or `vim` or `gedit`)**
- **Usage:** Opens a text editor to create or edit files.
- **Example using `nano`:**
  ```console
  nano myfile.txt
  ```

**üí°Note:** (You can then type text directly into the file and save it by pressing **`Ctrl + X`**, then **`Y`** to confirm changes, and **`Enter`** to save.)

## 5. Navigating Between Files and Directories üóÉÔ∏è

**Combining commands:**

- Create a directory and navigate into it:
  ```console
  mkdir project
  cd project
  ```

- Create a file within this new directory and write to it:
  ```console
  touch notes.txt
  echo "This is my project file" > notes.txt
  ```

- Check the content of the directory and read the file:
  ```console
  ls
  cat notes.txt
  ```

## 6. Practical Tasks ‚öîÔ∏è

1. Open the terminal.
2. Use `pwd` to check your current directory.
3. Create a directory named `SchoolWork`.
4. Navigate into `SchoolWork`.
5. Create a subdirectory named `Math`.
6. Navigate into `Math`.
7. Create a file named `homework.txt`.
8. Open `homework.txt` with `nano` and write "Math homework".
9. Save and exit the editor.
10. Navigate back to `SchoolWork`.
11. List all directories and files to verify your structure.

## ‚ú®Extra Credit

**Discuss with your classmates:**
- What each command does and when you might use it.
- Quiz each other to test your knowledge.

At the end of this lesson, you should gain a solid understanding of basic Linux commands, allowing you to navigate the file system, create and manage directories, and work with files effectively.
