### 1. Introduction to the Terminal

**Explain:**
The terminal is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with the computer using text commands. Unlike using a graphical interface (GUI), you can control the computer directly by typing commands.

### 2. Basic Commands

**a. Navigating the File System**

**Command: `pwd` (Print Working Directory)**
- **Usage:** Shows the current directory you are in.
- **Example:**
  ```sh
  pwd
  ```
  **Output:**
  ```sh
  /home/username
  ```

**Command: `ls` (List)**
- **Usage:** Lists files and directories in the current directory.
- **Example:**
  ```sh
  ls
  ```
  **Output:**
  ```sh
  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Videos
  ```

**Command: `cd` (Change Directory)**
- **Usage:** Changes the current directory to the specified directory.
- **Examples:**
  ```sh
  cd Documents
  cd ..
  cd /home/username
  ```

### 3. Creating and Managing Directories

**Command: `mkdir` (Make Directory)**
- **Usage:** Creates a new directory.
- **Example:**
  ```sh
  mkdir my_new_directory
  ```

### 4. Creating and Writing to Files

**Command: `touch`**
- **Usage:** Creates an empty file.
- **Example:**
  ```sh
  touch myfile.txt
  ```

**Command: `echo`**
- **Usage:** Writes text to a file.
- **Example:**
  ```sh
  echo "Hello, World!" > myfile.txt
  ```

**Command: `nano` (or `vim` or `gedit`)**
- **Usage:** Opens a text editor to create or edit files.
- **Example using `nano`:**
  ```sh
  nano myfile.txt
  ```
  (Students can then type text directly into the file and save it by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y` to confirm changes, and `Enter` to save.)

### 5. Navigating Between Files and Directories

**Combining commands:**

- **Create a directory and navigate into it:**
  ```sh
  mkdir project
  cd project
  ```

- **Create a file within this new directory and write to it:**
  ```sh
  touch notes.txt
  echo "This is my project file" > notes.txt
  ```

- **Check the content of the directory and read the file:**
  ```sh
  ls
  cat notes.txt
  ```

### 6. Practical Exercise

**Task for Students:**
1. Open the terminal.
2. Use `pwd` to check your current directory.
3. Create a directory named `SchoolWork`.
4. Navigate into `SchoolWork`.
5. Create a subdirectory named `Math`.
6. Navigate into `Math`.
7. Create a file named `homework.txt`.
8. Open `homework.txt` with `nano` and write "Math homework".
9. Save and exit the editor.
10. Navigate back to `SchoolWork`.
11. List all directories and files to verify your structure.

### 7. Review and Q&A

**Discuss:**
- What each command does and when you might use it.
- Answer any questions and provide further examples if needed.

By following this lesson plan, your students should gain a solid understanding of basic Linux commands, allowing them to navigate the file system, create and manage directories, and work with files effectively.
