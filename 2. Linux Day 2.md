# More Linux Command Line 📚🧑🏽‍💻

In this lesson, we will review the basic Linux commands covered in **1. Getting Started** and learn how to delete directories and files. 

We'll also introduce a few more useful commands for file management.

---

## 1. Review of Basic Commands 🧑‍🏫

Let's go over what we learned in the last lesson:

### Navigating the File System
- **`pwd`** - Print Working Directory
  
  ```console
  pwd
  ```
- **`ls`** - List files and directories
  
  ```console
  ls
  ```
- **`cd`** - Change Directory
  
  ```console
  cd Documents
  cd ..
  cd /home/username
  ```

### Creating and Managing Directories
- **`mkdir`** - Make Directory
  
  ```console
  mkdir my_new_directory
  ```

### Creating and Writing to Files
- **`touch`** - Create an empty file
  
  ```console
  touch myfile.txt
  ```
- **`echo`** - Write text to a file
  
  ```console
  echo "Hello, World!" > myfile.txt
  ```
- **`nano`** - Open a text editor to create or edit files
  
  ```console
  nano myfile.txt
  ```

## Challenge 1 - Practical Tasks ⚔️ 
Working with your classmates, see if you can complete the following task, based on what we learned last week _(i.e. navigating the file system, creating and managing directories, and working with files in Linux.)_


1. Open the Ubuntu terminal.

2. Print the current working directory.
   ```console
   pwd
   ```
3. List the contents of the current directory.
   ```console
   ls
   ```
4. Create a directory named `Practice`.
   ```console
   mkdir Practice
   ```
5. Navigate into `Practice`.
   ```console
   cd Practice
   ```
6. Create a file named `example.txt`.
   ```sh
   touch example.txt
   ```
7. Write "This is an example file." to `example.txt`.
   ```console
   echo "This is an example file." > example.txt
   ```
8. Create a subdirectory named `TestDir`.
   ```console
   mkdir TestDir
   ```
9. Move `example.txt` into `TestDir`.
   ```console
   mv example.txt TestDir
   ```
10. Copy `example.txt` to the parent directory (`Practice`).
    ```console
    cp TestDir/example.txt .
    ```

### Additional Tasks

1. Navigate back to the home directory.

    ```console
   cd ~
   ```
3. Create a directory named `Projects`.
   ```console
   mkdir Projects
   ```
4. Navigate into `Projects`.
   ```console
   cd Projects
   ```
5. Create a subdirectory inside `Projects` named `Project1`.
   ```console
   mkdir Project1
   ```
6. Navigate into `Project1`.
   ```console
   cd Project1
   ```
7. Create an empty file named `README.txt`.
   ```console
   touch README.txt
   ```
8. Write the text "This is the README file for Project1." into `README.txt`.
   ```console
   echo "This is the README file for Project1." > README.txt
   ```
9. Open `README.txt` with `nano` and add the line "Project1 description." Save and exit the editor.
   ```console
   nano README.txt
   ```

10. Navigate back to the `Projects` directory.
   ```console
   cd ..
   ```
11. List the contents to confirm `Project1` is created.
    ```console
    ls
    ```


## 2. Deleting Directories and Files 🗑️

### Deleting Files

**Command: `rm` (Remove)**
- **Usage:** Deletes a file.
- **Example:**
  ```sh
  rm myfile.txt
  ```

### Deleting an Empty Directory

**Command: `rmdir` (Remove Directory)**
- **Usage:** Deletes an empty directory.
- **Example:**
  ```sh
  rmdir my_empty_directory
  ```

### Deleting a Directory with Files

**Command: `rm -r` (Remove Recursively)**
- **Usage:** Deletes a directory and all its contents (files and subdirectories).
- **Example:**
  ```sh
  rm -r my_directory
  ```

**💡Note:** Be very careful with `rm -r`, as it will delete everything in the specified directory. Always double-check the directory path.

### Additional Safe Deletion Tip

**Command: `rm -ri` (Remove Recursively with Confirmation)**
- **Usage:** Prompts for confirmation before each deletion.
- **Example:**
  ```sh
  rm -ri my_directory
  ```

## 3. More Useful File Management Commands 📁

### Moving Files

**Command: `mv` (Move)**
- **Usage:** Moves or renames a file or directory.
- **Examples:**
  ```sh
  mv oldname.txt newname.txt
  mv file.txt /path/to/destination/
  ```

### Copying Files

**Command: `cp` (Copy)**
- **Usage:** Copies a file or directory.
- **Examples:**
  ```sh
  cp myfile.txt copy_of_myfile.txt
  cp -r my_directory/ /path/to/destination/
  ```

## 4. Practical Tasks ⚔️

1. Open the terminal.
2. Create a directory named `Practice`.
3. Navigate into `Practice`.
4. Create a file named `example.txt`.
5. Write "This is an example file." to `example.txt`.
6. Create a subdirectory named `TestDir`.
7. Move `example.txt` into `TestDir`.
8. Copy `example.txt` to the parent directory (`Practice`).
9. Delete `example.txt` in `TestDir`.
10. Delete the `TestDir` directory.

**Commands:**
```sh
mkdir Practice
cd Practice
touch example.txt
echo "This is an example file." > example.txt
mkdir TestDir
mv example.txt TestDir
cp TestDir/example.txt .
rm TestDir/example.txt
rmdir TestDir
```

## ✨Extra Credit

**Discuss with your classmates:**
- Why might it be important to double-check before using `rm -r`?
- Practice using `rm -ri` and notice how it asks for confirmation before each deletion.

At the end of this lesson, you should be more confident in your ability to navigate and manage the Linux file system, including how to safely delete files and directories.
```

This lesson builds on the first by reviewing previously covered material, introducing deletion commands, and adding more file management tools, which are crucial for a solid understanding of the Linux command line.
