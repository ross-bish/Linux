# More Linux Command Line 📚🧑🏽‍💻

In this lesson, we will review the basic Linux commands covered in **1. Getting Started** and learn how to delete directories and files. 

We'll also introduce a few more useful commands for file management.

## 1. Review of Basic Commands 🧑‍🏫

Let's go over what we learned in the last lesson:

### Navigating the File System
- **`pwd`** - Print Working Directory
  
  ```console
  pwd
  ```
- **`ls`** - List files and directories
  
  ```console
  ls
  ```
- **`cd`** - Change Directory
  
  ```console
  cd Documents
  cd ..
  cd /home/username
  ```

### Creating and Managing Directories
- **`mkdir`** - Make Directory
  
  ```console
  mkdir my_new_directory
  ```

### Creating and Writing to Files
- **`touch`** - Create an empty file
  
  ```console
  touch myfile.txt
  ```
- **`echo`** - Write text to a file
  
  ```console
  echo "Hello, World!" > myfile.txt
  ```
- **`nano`** - Open a text editor to create or edit files
  
  ```console
  nano myfile.txt
  ```

## 2. Deleting Directories and Files 🗑️

### Deleting Files

**Command: `rm` (Remove)**
- **Usage:** Deletes a file.
- **Example:**
  ```sh
  rm myfile.txt
  ```

### Deleting an Empty Directory

**Command: `rmdir` (Remove Directory)**
- **Usage:** Deletes an empty directory.
- **Example:**
  ```sh
  rmdir my_empty_directory
  ```

### Deleting a Directory with Files

**Command: `rm -r` (Remove Recursively)**
- **Usage:** Deletes a directory and all its contents (files and subdirectories).
- **Example:**
  ```sh
  rm -r my_directory
  ```

**💡Note:** Be very careful with `rm -r`, as it will delete everything in the specified directory. Always double-check the directory path.

### Additional Safe Deletion Tip

**Command: `rm -ri` (Remove Recursively with Confirmation)**
- **Usage:** Prompts for confirmation before each deletion.
- **Example:**
  ```sh
  rm -ri my_directory
  ```

## 3. More Useful File Management Commands 📁

### Moving Files

**Command: `mv` (Move)**
- **Usage:** Moves or renames a file or directory.
- **Examples:**
  ```sh
  mv oldname.txt newname.txt
  mv file.txt /path/to/destination/
  ```

### Copying Files

**Command: `cp` (Copy)**
- **Usage:** Copies a file or directory.
- **Examples:**
  ```sh
  cp myfile.txt copy_of_myfile.txt
  cp -r my_directory/ /path/to/destination/
  ```

## 4. Practical Tasks ⚔️

1. Open the terminal.
2. Create a directory named `Practice`.
3. Navigate into `Practice`.
4. Create a file named `example.txt`.
5. Write "This is an example file." to `example.txt`.
6. Create a subdirectory named `TestDir`.
7. Move `example.txt` into `TestDir`.
8. Copy `example.txt` to the parent directory (`Practice`).
9. Delete `example.txt` in `TestDir`.
10. Delete the `TestDir` directory.

**Commands:**
```sh
mkdir Practice
cd Practice
touch example.txt
echo "This is an example file." > example.txt
mkdir TestDir
mv example.txt TestDir
cp TestDir/example.txt .
rm TestDir/example.txt
rmdir TestDir
```

## ✨Extra Credit

**Discuss with your classmates:**
- Why might it be important to double-check before using `rm -r`?
- Practice using `rm -ri` and notice how it asks for confirmation before each deletion.

At the end of this lesson, you should be more confident in your ability to navigate and manage the Linux file system, including how to safely delete files and directories.
```

This lesson builds on the first by reviewing previously covered material, introducing deletion commands, and adding more file management tools, which are crucial for a solid understanding of the Linux command line.
